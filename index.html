             <p class="detail">Team Endeavour is the official robotics team of SLIET Longowal, founded by quintuplets from various engineering backgrounds in 2014. The delegation provides a wholesome technical milieu where the inquisitive minds get a platform to sculpt their knacks that transfrom into greater assets that indeed land them in handsome pursuits. At present the team comprises of 50+ smartworking rookies, leading by example, instigating comon interest in Robotics, from diverse fields work in harmony marshaling their departments from the upfront. Every individual in the team is well versed with programming, circuit-designing, fabricating and simulation, the skills that are prerequisites in this realm. With every passing year the team plans to push it's limits and come out of the comfort zone.</p>

             <h2>VISION</h2>
         </div>
         <div class="vision-info">
             <p>The team was founded with the intentions to encourage engineering undergraduates to be able to understand different technology stacks used in robotics, outside their regular curriculum. Now, the team participates in competitions both at college as well as national levels. The main motive is to make students aware of the upcoming technologies not just by mugging up the theories but also by practically implementing the theories they've learnt. The outstanding achievements of the team in the last few years has attracted a great amount of eligible students to its door, thereby helping the team excel in every field,either be learning or managing and holding the team together. Hence, with ambitious goals and a well built team, the team has decided to take part in international events too.

         </div>
         <div class="mission-info">
             <p>The team was initially started to reinforce the technical prospect of students, enabling them to become refined concocts having knowledge of diverse fields. Following the current trends, everyone is in hunt to become that polymath, who is capable of handling any work assigned. So for this, what will be better than working in the field of robotics. A field that needs no introduction where people from varied backgrounds come and work in harmony, contribute their part and learn in reciprocation. Robotics is the collective implementation of latest technologies & using it for our ease that certainly requires profound technical expertise. According to a survey conducted by a reputed firm, around 80% of engineers are not employable for the industry. These statistics don't need any explanation as such, so our initiative is just a contribution to bring a change & enhance the technical calibre of engineering graduates.

An RC Car is a nitro-engine car that accelerates within seconds to breathtaking speeds that is tough to follow. The fuel used is nitromethyle, that appetizes the hunger of a FormulaOne. This raging hobby is for the speed demons seeking some serious kickstart. Enthusiastic rookies can churn their driving skills, make jumps & turns, and catch some air with full throttle to unleash their fangs.</p>
